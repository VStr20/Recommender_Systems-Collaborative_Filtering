# Recommender_Systems-Collaborative_Filtering

This repository 2 notebooks using different methods to implement recommender systems.
1. Using correlation among users to recommend movies based on the movies they rated earlier. Correlation(on a scale of 0-1) is higher when the users have similar interests and lower when they have different interests.
2. Using Deep Learning to learn the values of weights and bias(parameters) to evalute the recommendations that can be suggested to the user.
